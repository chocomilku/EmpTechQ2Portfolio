**If you have no social change or cause involvement, any social event will do just like a class project, a family affair, or a celebration where you could use ICTs to contribute your knowledge to make an announcement, a meme, or a video clip may be used for this class sharing.

- _I've done a film before using a laptop to edit the clips and a Phone to record it. It is a class project where we will act through a film the story “Ibong Adarna”. This helped us classmates to get together in many places to shoot a scene. I used ICT as my backbone to create a beautiful product. I followed tutorials on the internet on how to do things. In the end, the film we made was successful and given a high grade._
